## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
**QuantumAlbe/QuantumAlbe** is a ğŸ‘¾_ quantum_ ğŸ‘¾ engineering student of Politecnico di Torino. I study both ğŸ‘¾_quantum_ğŸ‘¾ hardware design and ğŸ‘¾_quantum_ğŸ‘¾ computing. We say ğŸ‘¾_quantum_ğŸ‘¾ a lot of times more than needed.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ‘¾ I studied physical engineering (bachelor) at PoliTo 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently try to learn programming (ğŸ‘¾_quantum_ğŸ‘¾ programming)  :( 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: alberto.polato@studenti.polito.it
